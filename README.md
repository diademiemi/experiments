# Experiments
This repository contains a number of experiments, code dumps and other things that don't really fit anywhere else. If I ever need to do something quickly to test an idea, I'll probably put it here. I figured it was a waste to keep it to myself, maybe someone else will find it useful.

I'm not promising that any of this code is good, is documented, or even works properly. I'll be providing zero support for any of this code, so use at your own risk.
